        What I <span class="lx-highlight lx-current-highlight" data-idx="0" style="background-color:#F9DEDC;">Worked On</span>
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="1" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">February 2021</span>
Before college the two main things I worked on, outside of school, 
were <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="2" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">writing</span> and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="3" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">programming</span>. I didn&#x27;t write essays. I <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="4" style="background-color:#F9DEDC;">wrote</span> what 
beginning writers were supposed to write then, and probably still are: 
short stories. My stories were awful. They had hardly any plot, just 
characters with strong feelings, which I imagined made them deep.
The first programs I tried writing were <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="5" style="background-color:#F9DEDC;">on the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="6" style="background-color:#FEF0C3;">IBM 1401</span> that our 
school district used for what was then called &quot;data processing.&quot; This 
was in 9th grade</span>, so I was <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="7" style="background-color:#FFDDBE;">13 or 14</span>. The school district&#x27;s 1401 
happened to be in the basement of our junior high school, and my 
friend <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="8" style="background-color:#FEF0C3;">Rich Draves</span> and I got permission to use it. It was like a mini 
Bond villain&#x27;s lair down there, with all these alien-looking machines 
— CPU, disk drives, printer, card reader — sitting up on a raised 
floor under bright fluorescent lights.
The language we used was an early version of <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="9" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Fortran</span>. You had to <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="10" style="background-color:#F9DEDC;">type 
programs on <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="11" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">punch cards</span>, then stack them in the card reader and press 
a button to load the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="12" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">program into memory and run it</span>. The result would 
ordinarily be to print something on the spectacularly loud printer.
I was <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="13" style="background-color:#F9DEDC;">puzzled by the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="14" style="background-color:#FEF0C3;">1401</span></span>. I couldn&#x27;t figure out what to do with it. 
And in retrospect there&#x27;s not much I could have done with it. The only 
form of input to programs was data stored on punched cards, and I 
didn&#x27;t have any data stored on punched cards. The only other option 
was to do things that didn&#x27;t rely on any input, like calculate 
approximations of pi</span>, but I didn&#x27;t know enough math to do anything 
interesting of that type. So I&#x27;m not surprised I can&#x27;t remember any 
programs I wrote, because they can&#x27;t have done much. My clearest 
memory is of the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="15" style="background-color:#F9DEDC;">moment I learned it was possible for programs not to 
terminate, when one of mine didn&#x27;t</span>. On a <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="16" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">machine without time-sharing</span>, 
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="17" style="background-color:#F9DEDC;">this was a social as well as a technical error</span>, as the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="18" style="background-color:#FEF0C3;">data center 
manager</span>&#x27;s expression made clear.
With <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="19" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">microcomputers</span>, everything changed.
